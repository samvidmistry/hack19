To that end, we need more help tackling some very big engineering projects so we can handle our next leg of growth.

However, now we’re moving over to the Shopify platform and strategically integrating our existing platform.  That requires a complex analysis on which system does which part the best and building a smart integration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs another example, we build our own custom dashboards to precisely track our advertising efforts.  To that end, we integrate with Google and Facebook’s APIs to ingest all the data they provide.

To that end, communication is key to this role, as is the ability to self-motivate and quickly turn a business conversation into an actionable set of dev tasks that you can jump on immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho is This Opportunity Perfect for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnybody who truly is a top coder and creative architect who might relate to any of these:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re tired of the commute, sick of burning the midnight oil, stress is dominating your life, and the cost of real estate is eating up your retirement, this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, if you’ve always wanted to be a part of the thrill of a rapidly growing company, but didn’t want to move to an expensive big city with all the madness, stress and high cost that brings, this is your opportunity to stay where you are (or move to where you always wanted to go) to design your ideal life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, if you’re drowning in the corporate world, suffocating from constantly shifting priorities that nobody agrees on, incessant scope creep, micromanaging bosses, endless meetings, constant interruptions and no respect for the quiet time you need to actually get work done, this is your opportunity to simplify and go deep – to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity… and scale it like never before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day… AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please read on, as we can’t wait to meet you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho Are We and What’s the Company’s Background?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur mission is to spread our metabolism-first way of living we’ve been busy perfecting for 8 years to a worldwide audience.  It’s a lifestyle that’s 100% focused on getting you the results that matter:  looking your best, feeling your best and doing your best. In the shortest time possible.  And in a way that sticks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s why our tag line is “Life’s Short.  Make it Count.”  It puts you back in control.  It empowers you to fix your own problems.  And it makes you want to tell the world about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur vision is to do this by becoming a billion-dollar multi-channel brand that’s distributed via online, mobile and physical retail.  We’ve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework and high-performance culture to make this happen.  And now we’re ready for a much larger stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve built a full ecosystem of products and services that allow someone to live a metabolism-first lifestyle.  This includes exercise and nutrition programs, nutraceuticals, functional foods and membership programs.  We’re launching a mobile app next year, then will push into offline retail, extend into home-delivered meals and more.  But ONE thing at a time, just like we’ve done for 8 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur next major step is rolling out our new Metabolic Living brand and centralized e-commerce website at \u003ca href=\"http://www.metabolicliving.com\"\u003ewww.metabolicliving.com\u003c/a\u003e, using highly customized Shopify implementation, by September.  As part of this, we will sunset our old brand, Natural Health Sherpa, and consolidate our various product-driven microsites like at \u003ca href=\"http://www.metabolicrenewal.com\"\u003ewww.metabolicrenewal.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why is a metabolism-first lifestyle needed?  Because there are record amounts of sick, overweight, tired and depressed people piling up in virtually every country.  Why is that?  Because we’re over-worked, over-stressed, over-fed and toxic.  And we’re deprived of the sleep, nutrition, exercise, movement and relaxation we need to thrive.  That’s a recipe for disaster.  And we’re seeing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting and exercise trap people into a 1-step-forward-2-steps back vicious cycle that actually makes them worse off.  They bounce around from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making any progress… staying trapped in a downward spiral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRigid philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create an us-vs-them tribal mentality that’s self-limiting.  Neither of those philosophies work for all people all the time… or even the same person all the time.  People differ.  People change.  If that’s not respected, things will backfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe, on the other hand, present a framework that allows you to customize your life in a way that works best for you, so you can reach your fullest metabolic potential.  Because we’ve found through working with millions of people that a fully optimized metabolism is what delivers the results you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of fighting against your body or your life, we empower you to work with your body and life to create the perfect program for you.  One that’s practical.  One that’s sustainable.  One that’s enjoyable.  And, most importantly, one that delivers the results you want at any stage of life.  And fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we practice what we preach:  our company is designed so everyone on our team both enjoys their work challenges while having plenty of time to do what they most in their life.  We recruit only high-performing, humble people who produce in fast cycles, hold themselves accountable and have fun. And we invest a TON into our team, mentoring, coaching, teaching high performance habits and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are the Requirements?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep experience as an end-to-end web application developer/web architect responsible for every single part of the project including requirements gathering, project management, system architecture, infrastructure setup, coding, integrating with 3rd parties, documenting and testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy marketing-systems focus with deep experience in e-commerce, payment processing, split testing, funnel development, analytics, page speed optimization, API integrations, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10+ years’ experience as a software engineer/web developer with recent, applicable focus on database-driven web applications on a LAMP stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpert-level, working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; our design team creates most of the assets, but you’ll be implementing, optimizing, troubleshooting, and adding functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbility to build complex PHP applications quickly, efficiently, and under pressure.
